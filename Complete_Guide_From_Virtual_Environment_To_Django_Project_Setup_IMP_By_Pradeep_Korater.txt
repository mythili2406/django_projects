1.Working with Virtual environment:


  1.1. pip install virtualenv (In command prompt enter this command to Install the Virtual environment Package)

  1.2. Creating the Project Directory/Folder    (Name them as Project1, Project2 etc..)

  1.3. python -m venv myenv  (In the Project Directory you Created open Command Prompt Use this command to Create the Virtual environment named myenv) 

  1.4. myenv\Scripts\activate

  1.5. install  Packages    
     pip install <package-name>   
    
     example: pip install Django


(Continue with (Step 2.1) of "2.Guide to setting up Django Project" which is given below to Create Django Project and Django Applications)





  * pip freeze > requirements.txt

   #Creates a text file named requirements.txt which contains the list of all the packages required to run the particular project, along with their versions

  *  python install -r requirements.txt

    #the above command installs the packages mentioned inside the requirements.txt all at once 

    # Use this when you are working with a different device, Usually when transferring the entire project files with your teammates(we can avoid myenv folder since its not suitable to share it in all platforms as the size will be larger)  


  
  * use deactivate  command to deactivate the particular virtual environment




2.Guide to setting up a Django project:

  2.1. Install Django
      
      Make sure Python is installed. Then open your terminal and run:

      pip install Django


  2.2. Create a Django Project
       
       django-admin startproject project_name

       or 

       python -m django startproject project_name


       Example:
       django-admin startproject Student_Management

       or

       python -m django startproject Student_Management

   
      This creates a folder named Student_Management/ with necessary files.



   
   2.3. Navigate into the Project Folder

        cd Student_Project


   2.4. Run the Development Server
    
        python manage.py runserver


     Open your browser and go to:
     http://127.0.0.1:8000
     You’ll see the Django welcome page.


	

   2.5. Create a Django App
    Inside your project folder:

   python manage.py startapp app_name

   Example:

   python manage.py startapp student_app

   This creates a new app folder named student_app/.

 
   2.6. Add App to Settings
   
    Open Student_Management/settings.py and add your app in INSTALLED_APPS:


   INSTALLED_APPS = [
      ...
      'student_app',
    ]


   2.7. Create Database Tables
   Run the initial migrations:

   i)  python manage.py makemigrations
   ii) python manage.py migrate

   
   2.8. Start Building Views and URLs

   Define views in student_app/views.py, and map them in student_app/urls.py (create this file if it doesn’t exist), then include it in the project’s urls.py.
